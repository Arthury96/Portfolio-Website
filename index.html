                <p>In 2008, when the company’s team overgrew the old office and every 
                    morning you could find two more colleagues sitting in your chair – 
                    we decided to look for a new home. Initially, our first architectural
                     project was commissioned by Zurab Tsereteli, but for its construction 
                     we’d have to demolish a couple of neighbourhoods, which meant losing
                      a lot of potential customers. Our next idea was to move to the 
                      Presidential palace, but it turned out to be busy. So, when we finally
                       found a cosy building at Straupes Street, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

                <p>Our customer service centre is a warm and cosy place – over 150 people visit it daily. 
                    We are especially pleased when clients visit us with their children – we even have a 
                    small play corner for kids to draw and read.
                    We also have a bookshelf with a collection of rare editions, a coffee machine with an
                     amazingly delicious coffee and a large TV. There were times when sports fans gathered
                     at our service centre just to watch a football match. Fun fact – they were not even
                      our customers!</p>

                <img src="styles/img/stockfresh_8245621_female-customer-services-agent-in-call-center_sizeS.jpg" alt="New Connections Department">
                <p>In the department of new connections, a telephone is the main working tool – our operators 
                    process up to 500 calls per day. Can you imagine that? On average, each employee in this 
                    department wears out 2 telephones per year.
                    When hiring new employees, we make them pass two tests: the first one in typography and 
                    the second one in “tongue twister.” We have a theory that if you wake up our new connection 
                    specialist in the middle of the night, he will name every possible service at any Riga address
                     without hesitation. And he will ask if you’d like to connect telephony as well.

                <img src="styles/img/imgg.jpg" alt="Business Customer Department">
                <p>It's one thing to find an individual solution for a client, connect him to the services, provide
                     an interrupted Internet and television connection. And it’s a completely different thing – if 
                     your client is not one person, but an entire company. For the best business solutions, they 
                     turn to this department.
                    The main criteria when hiring someone here are high oratory skills and a strong handshake. The 
                    team of this department had more than 855 handshakes over the past 2 years.</p>

                <img src="styles/img/images.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Even after a short work experience in the department, our round-the-clock technical assistance 
                    operators can easily obtain an extra education in psychology — sometimes clients contact the 
                    technical department, because they are in need of psychological support due to the loss of the
                     Internet. Our technical operators are especially pleased with night calls, asking to solve a 
                     TV problem like: “I can't find my remote!” In any case, customer problems are solved with all 
                     care and seriousness.</p>
